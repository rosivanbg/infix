## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## How to Contribute

We use a standard GitHub fork-and-pull-request workflow.

1.  **Find or Create an Issue**: Before starting significant work, please check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/sanko/infix/issues) to see if there's an existing issue for what you want to do. If not, please create one to start a discussion. This ensures that your proposed change aligns with the project's goals before you invest time in it.
2.  **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the main repository to your own GitHub account.
3.  **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix from the `main` branch. Please use a descriptive name.

    ```bash
    # For a new feature:
    git checkout -b feature/add-riscv-support
    # For a bug fix:
    git checkout -b fix/struct-classification-bug
    ```

4.  **Make Your Changes**: Write your code. Please adhere to the existing coding style and add comments to new or complex logic.
5.  **Test Your Changes**: A pull request is far more likely to be accepted if it includes tests. If you add new functionality, please add a corresponding test case.
6.  **Update the Changelog**: Add an entry to the `[Unreleased]` section of `CHANGELOG.md` describing your change.
7.  **Submit a Pull Request**: Push your branch to your fork and open a pull request against the `main` branch of the original repository. Please provide a clear description of your changes and link to the relevant issue (e.g., `Fixes #123`).
